Well this is just a simple song
To say what you done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
And you feel like an ocean
Being warmed by the sun

When I was just nine years old
I swear that I dreamed
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest
